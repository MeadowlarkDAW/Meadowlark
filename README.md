Meadowlark is a (currently incomplete) project that aims to be a FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. Its goals are to be a powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

### ***This project is still in the early stages of development and is not ready for any kind of production use or any alpha/beta testing. Please see below on how you can get involved to help us develop this project!***
