Meadowlark is a (currently incomplete) project that aims to be a FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. Its goals are to be a powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

### ***This project is still in the early stages of development and is not ready for any kind of production use or any alpha/beta testing. Please see below on how you can get involved to help us develop this project!***

## Get Involved

Before contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct].

* Come join us on our [Discord Server]! *(music artists, designers, developers, and general users welcome!)*

* We are also active in the [Rust Audio Discord Server] where we develop some of the generic backend modules for the [RustyDAW] project. Please keep discussions there about the [RustyDAW] project and not about Meadowlark specifically. *(developers only please)*

* Developers may take a look at the current [Design Document]. Note we are currently not accepting code contributions to the core project until things are more fleshed out and less "experimental". However, we *will* be accepting contributions to any DSP since that can easily be delegated and developed in parallel. Take a look at the [DSP Design Document] if you are interested.

* Meadowlark is currently being used as a testbed for the upcoming [Tuix] GUI library, and we are working close with the developer for the benefit of both projects. If a GUI library written in Rust interests you, please check them out and give them your support!
