/// The `StateSystem` struct is in charge of listening to `Action`s sent from sources
/// such as UI views and scripts, and then mutating state and manipulating the backend
/// accordingly.
///
/// No other struct is allowed to mutate this state or manipulate the backend. They
/// must send `AppAction`s to this struct to achieve this.
///
/// State is divided into two parts: the `SourceState` and the `WorkingState`.
/// * The `SourceState` contains all state in the app/project which serves as
/// the "source of truth" that all other state is derived from. This can be thought of
/// as the state that gets saved to disk when saving a project or a config file.
/// * The `WorkingState` contains all the working state of the application. This
/// includes things like lenses to UI elements, as well as cached data for the
/// position of elements in the timeline view.
