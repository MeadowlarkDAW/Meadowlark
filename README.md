Meadowlark is a (work in progress) FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. It aims to be a powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

**Meadowlark is in the process of being completely rewritten with a new tech stack. Stay tuned for progress updates.**

> If you wish to see the old code, it is in the `old` and `dev-(old)` branches.

**Latest design mockup, not a screenshot. This design is out of date now that Meadowlark has changed direction, but the general styling and feel will be the same. There will no longer be an inline horizontal FX rack.*
