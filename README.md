Meadowlark is a (work in progress) FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. It aims to be a powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

**Meadowlark is in a temporary hiatus while I figure out a direction for this project. Stay tuned for updates.**

> If you wish to see the old code, it is in the `old` and `dev-(old)` branches.
