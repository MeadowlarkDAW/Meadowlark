## **Meadowlark and all its subprojects are in a temporary hiatus while I restructure things and figure out a plan on how to move forward with this project.**

Meadowlark is a (currently incomplete) project that aims to be a FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. Its goals are to be a powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

***This project is still in the early stages of development and is not ready for any kind of production use or even any alpha/beta testing. Also the `main` branch may fail to build while the bulk of development is happening in the `dev` branch. Please see below on how you can get involved to help us develop this project!***
