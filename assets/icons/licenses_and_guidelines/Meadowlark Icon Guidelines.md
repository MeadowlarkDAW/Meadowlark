# Meadowlark Icon Guidelines

The default icon theme in Meadowlark should follow the style of the [Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons) icon pack with the following parameters:

* stroke weight: 1.5
* size for toolbar icons: 24
* size for browser item icons: 20
* style: outline (unless the nature of the icon requires a filled style, i.e. a filled star showing that a browser item is "favorited" as apposed to an non-favorited browser item which has an outline star)
* color: black

Icons should be symbolic (as in a single solid color), with the exception of some brand icons.

Include the size of the icon in the name (this makes it easier for others to create custom icon themes)

Consider contributing any icons we create back to the Tabler project.
